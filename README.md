# House Price Prediction

I tried well-known Kaggle challange House Price Predictions. The dataset had 80+ columns and was fun dataset to work on. The solution notebook includes the important steps for having successful Machine Learning model such as:
  1) Missing value imputation
  2) Exploratory Data Analysis
  3) Feature Selection
  4) Feature enginnering (scaling, encoding) 
  5) Model and model parameter selection with GridSearchCV
